# node-red-contrib-ffpass

This module enables you to control your Ford car via the FordPass API within [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/).

### âš  Important note
ffpass needs at least Node 12.x because it uses the [fromEntries()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries) method. Hence this module currently doesn't work with any earlier Node version.
